# GrowTime!

## Purpose

As an aspiring home gardener, I need to learn the basics of gardening, so that I can build my own garden at home to grow my own food. When I visit the homepage, then I am presented with what vegetables are in season as well as links to more detailed information. When I click on a vegetable, I am taken to a page with specific information about growing that vegetable. When I view the menu at the top, I am given various options for more tools I can use. When I click on RECIPES, I am taken to a page with a recipe search so I can utilize my harvest. When I click on WEATHER, I am given the current local weather forecast. When I click on the additional links, I am taken to different pages with specific information on garden-related topics.
