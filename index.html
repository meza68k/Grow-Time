             <h2>What Do I Need to Get Started?</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>A sunny location that gets at least 6-8 hours of sunlight per day.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Depending on your space allotment: lots of pots (most veggies do well in pots!), raised beds (wood is ideal) or a spot on the ground that has been tilled and is free from grass and weeds</li>
                <br>
                <li>Good soil and tons of COMPOST</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is compost? Organic material (veggie scraps, yard clippings, etc) that has been naturally broken down into super nutrient-dense soil.</li>
                        <li>Where do I get it? Any local gardening supply shop will have some. Or you can make your own! </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Mulch! This will go on top of your soil, around the plants, to hold in moisture that evaporates quickly in the Texas heat.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Seeds or transplants. If you are just getting into growing, transplants are the way to go. Your local garden shop will have anything available that’s in season.</li>
                <br>
                <li>A water source. Even watering is important for growing food so, make sure you set a watering schedule for yourself or set up a automated timer system through your outdoor faucet or sprinkler system. Always check the weather to see when Mother Nature might give you some FREE water!</li>
                <br>
                <li>Plant food. Plants need to eat just like we do! Set yourself a regular feeding schedule so your plants don’t go hungry.</li>
             </ul>

             <h3>Don’t Forget About Herbs!</h3>
             <p>(this will also need to be dynamic to update time of year)
                Herbs are very easy to grow and can save you a ton of money at the grocery store. They are a very easy way to add some freshness and flavor to your meals!
